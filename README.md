# NTFS *-NOT*
The Windows filesystem, called the New Technology File System, or NTFS, is a closed source filesystem that uses letters for drives, e.g the `C:\` for pretty much everything, the `D:\` drive for a CD/DVD drive, `E:\` for a USB device, etc, all the way up to `Z:\`, in which case Windows tells you that you can't go any farther (how can you have that many drives? That's a lot of USB/I don't know). This is similar, but it's open source. This is what the Windows filesystem drives are for:
1. the `A:` drive is for a floppy disk
2. the `B:` drive is also for a floppy disk
3. the `C:` drive is for everything, from the system to your files, as long as they're on the hard drive
4. the `D:` drive is for CD/DVD player
5. the `E:` drive is for a USB stick, I think
6. the `F:` - `Z:` drives are for any other things you have, but that would be a lot of USB/SD/Beats Me ports.
